## Differences Between XML, SVG, and HTML

XML, SVG, and HTML are all markup languages used in web development, but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Below is a detailed comparison of these three technologies.

### **1. XML (Extensible Markup Language)**

- **Purpose**: XML is designed primarily for data exchange and storage. It allows users to define their own tags, making it highly flexible for representing structured information.
- **Structure**: XML documents must be well-formed, meaning they adhere strictly to syntax rules. Tags are case-sensitive, and every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag.
- **Usage**: Commonly used for data interchange between systems (e.g., web services), XML encodes data in a format that is both machine-readable and human-readable. It does not dictate how data should be displayed.
- **Example**:
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0"?>
  <note>
      <to>Tove</to>
      <from>Jani</from>
      <heading>Reminder</heading>
      <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
  </note>
  ```

### **2. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**

- **Purpose**: HTML is primarily used for creating and displaying content on the web. It structures web pages and defines how elements are presented in a browser.
- **Structure**: HTML has predefined tags (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<a>`), which are not case-sensitive. While some tags can be self-closing, most require both opening and closing tags.
- **Usage**: HTML is focused on presentation, allowing developers to create user interfaces for websites and applications. It does not support custom tags like XML.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <title>My Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
      <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
      <p>This is my first web page.</p>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

### **3. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**

- **Purpose**: SVG is an XML-based format specifically for defining vector graphics on the web. It allows for the creation of interactive graphics that can scale without losing quality.
- **Structure**: As a subset of XML, SVG inherits its rules (e.g., case sensitivity, well-formedness). SVG elements can be styled with CSS and manipulated with JavaScript.
- **Usage**: Ideal for logos, icons, and complex graphics that need to remain crisp at any size. SVG graphics are part of the DOM, allowing for interactivity and animation.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <svg width="100" height="100">
      <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
  </svg>
  ```

### **Comparison Summary**

| Feature              | XML                             | HTML                              | SVG                                  |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Primary Use**      | Data exchange                   | Content presentation               | Vector graphics                       |
| **Tag Definition**   | Custom-defined                  | Predefined                        | Inherits from XML                    |
| **Case Sensitivity** | Yes                             | No                               | Yes                                  |
| **Well-formedness**  | Required                        | Not strictly required             | Required                             |
| **Interactivity**     | Limited                         | High with JavaScript              | High with CSS and JavaScript         |
| **Scalability**      | Not applicable                  | Not applicable                    | Scalable without quality loss        |

### Conclusion

In summary, while XML is focused on data representation and exchange, HTML is dedicated to displaying content on the web, and SVG provides a means to create scalable vector graphics. Each serves a unique role in web development, making them essential tools for different tasks within the ecosystem.
